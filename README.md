# Ozone Blockchain

Ozone is a entirely self-developed blockchain compatiable with IPFS to ensure continued decentralization.

## Breakdown

### BLOCK_ARC:
- block.cpp - Defines block contents, manages hash generation, defines print parameters.
- blockchain.cpp - Initialized genesis block, manages and validates chain.
- hash_utils.cpp - Manages hash/key/signiture generagtion and calculation. 
- ipfs_utils.cpp - Uploads data to ipfs from a given node.
- proof_of_work.cpp - Outlines mining system, hash difficulty, and nonce creation,
- transaction.cpp - Defines transaction structure.

### NETWORKING:
 - ipfs_actor.scala - Grabs dats from ipfs http link with specific hash (hard-encoded as of now).
 - ipfs_dispatch.scala - Transmits transactions to all nodes on the network.
 - node_actor.scala - Defines node paths and how data is read at nodes.
